//Java Constructors
//A constructor in Java is a special method, that is used to initialize objects.
//
//The constructor is called when an object of a class is created.
//
//It can be used to set initial values for object attributes:
public class constructors {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //creating objects for cars using car_details file
        car_details car1 = new car_details(4,"BMW","50 lakhs");
         System.out.println();
    }
}
